### 🚀 What I Do
Currently a machine learning engineer at Treverse LLC (A reverse logitstic company in Nashville). I make things happen in the intersection of research and engineering.

- Tackle difficult or fun problems
- Get things done nicely and efficiently
- Think creatively for all sorts of things


---

### 🔬 Spotlight: Inverse-LLaVA
A novel multi-modality framework that removes the alignment pre-training stage by inverting the common projection paradigm. Instead of forcing modalities into a homogenized latent early, each retains its native structure until a selective fusion core resolves shared semantics.

Core principles:
- Inverse projection
- Fidelity preservation over forced alignment
- Modular fusion kernels
---

### 🛠 Stack & Tools
- Languages: Python, Go
- ML Frameworks: PyTorch (primary), JAX (on deck)
- Infra / Ops: AWS, Kubernetes
- Patterns: Multi-modality, representation learning, efficiency

---

### 🧪 Current Focus
- New architectures for multi-modality models
- New architecutres for general deep learning
- Robots with real capabilities for everyday tasks

---

### 💡 Philosophy
Les is Mor
